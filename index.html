<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4">About</h2>
          <p>This is a basic 12 column grid CSS framework.  It is 'utility first'.  No pre-built '.button', '.navbar', '.dropdown', or '.card' classes are provided.</p><br>
          <p>Users are encouraged to style elements by directly adding the basic utility classes in their HTML.  For example, insead of styling a button by adding a '.button' class to an input element, a variety of perhaps '.border', '.background-color', '.padding', and '.box-shadow' classes may be added to the input element to style the button.</p><br>
          <p>This approach was chosen for the ease of the creation, maintenance, and extension of the framework.  At some point, if desired, component classes can be extracted.  As you get used to the class names, you'll eventually be able to style entire pages without ever looking at the CSS.
