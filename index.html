<br>
<p>
  This is a basic 12 column grid, utility-first CSS framework. 
</p><br>
<p>
  No pre-built component classes are provided.
  Users are encouraged to style elements by directly adding the basic utility classes in their HTML.  
  For example, insead of styling a button by adding a <span class="mono bg-gray-200">.button</span> component class to an input element, 
  utility classes like <span class="mono bg-gray-200">.border .bg-gray-500 .p-3 .box-shadow</span> may be added instead.
</p><br>
<p>
  This approach was chosen for the ease of the creation, maintenance, and extension of the framework.  
  At some point, if desired, component classes can be extracted.  As you get used to the class names, 
  you'll eventually be able to style entire pages without ever looking at the CSS.  More can be read
