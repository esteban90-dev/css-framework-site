<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4 text-center">Reset</h2>

<p>
  A slightly tweaked CSS 'reset' was used from <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" target="_blank" class="link-no-underline">Eric Meyer</a> 
  to set all html elements to a consistent baseline.  Unlike the Eric Meyer version, list style types are not modified.
